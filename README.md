# Warrior-PY

<div align="center">
  <strong>An exciting game of programming and Artificial Intelligence</strong>
</div>

<br />


In WarriorPY, you wear the skin of a warrior climbing a tall tower to reach _The
Pythonic Sword_ at the top level. Legend has it that the sword bearer becomes
enlightened in the python language, but be warned: the journey will not be
easy. On each floor, you need to write Python to instruct the warrior to
battle enemies, rescue captives, and reach the stairs alive...

**No matter if you are new to programming or a Python guru, WarriorPY will
put your skills to the test. Will you dare?**

## Quick Start

1.  Install WarriorPY with [pip](https://pypi.org):

```sh
pip install warriorPY
```

2.  Launch the game:

```sh
warriorpy
```

3.  Create your warrior.

4.  You'll be pointed to a README file with instructions for the first level.

Good luck in your journey, warrior!
